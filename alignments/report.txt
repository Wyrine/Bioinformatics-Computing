1. The files are in human.fasta and fruit_fly.fasta respectively.
2. globalign is written in python3 and needs the external numpy library in order to run.
   It is an executable and is names globalign.py and thus can be run with the command ./globalign.py
   It can optionally take command up to 5 command line arguments. The first two are the files to be
   compared and the next three are scores such that argv[3] = match_score, argv[4] = mismatch_score
   and argv[5] = gap_fee.
   
   Optimal Global Alignment Score: -1016

3. localign is written in python3 and needs the external numpy library in order to run.
   It is an executable and is names localign.py and thus can be run with the command ./localign.py
   It can optionally take command up to 5 command line arguments. The first two are the files to be
   compared and the next three are scores such that argv[3] = match_score, argv[4] = mismatch_score
   and argv[5] = gap_fee.

   Optimal Local Alignment Score: 820

4. egfalign is written in python3 and needs the external numpy library in order to run.
   It is an executable and is names egfalign.py and thus can be run with the command ./egfalign.py
   It can optionally take command up to 5 command line arguments. The first two are the files to be
   compared and the next three are scores such that argv[3] = match_score, argv[4] = mismatch_score
   and argv[5] = gap_fee.

	 Optimal End Gap Free Score: 620

5. Alignment length: 1269, Identity: 73%, E-Value: 4e-65, Range1: 399, Range2: 204, Total: 603.
   Max score: 235. Both scores were positive thus there is some region that overlaps.

6. Blasttn: Top hits: Homo sapiens sonic Hedgehog: Accession: NG_007504.2 
   Blastx: Predicted: sonic hedgehog protein isoform X1: Accession: XP_011514781.1

7. egf-linear.py is written in python3 and needs the external numpy library in order to run.
		It is an executable and thus can be run with the command ./egf-linear.py
		It can optionally take command line arguments of up to 5. The first two are the files to be
		compared and the next three are scores such that argv[3] = match_score, argv[4] = mismatch_score
		and argv[5] = gap_fee.

		Optimal End Gap Free Score: 620
