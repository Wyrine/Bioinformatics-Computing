CS 594 Report

2) The program that computes the hamming distance is ham.py and needs numpy installed. It also
		needs globalign.py to be in the same directory. ham.py can be run with './ham.py small.fasta'
		and the command line argument is required. The result is already stored in small.out.txt

3) The tree is attached as drawnTree.pdf

5) Resulting file from dnadist is: dist.out.txt
		Resulting files from kitch are: kitchFile.txt and kitchTree.txt
		Resulting files from neighbor are: neighborFile.txt and neighborTree.txt
		
		The trees generated aren't very consistent and thus is likely due to the ultrametric property
		assumption that UPGMA makes. The data set likely does not satisfy that assumption and thus using
		UPGMA does not create good trees.

6) Clustal output file is clustalOutput.txt
		Muscle output file is muscleOutput.txt
				Note: Both are in clustalW format with the clustal also having character count

		- The clustal and muscle trees seem similar to neighbor but not to kitch.
		- Clustal and Muscle largely seem to agree on the tree information.
