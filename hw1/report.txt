1. I agree to the honor code statement in the syllabus.

3. The program that reverse complements the sequence is rev.py which 
	 is already an executable and thus can just be executed as "./rev.py" 
	 but can be given a command line argument as a .fasta file in order to 
	 reverse complement other files. 

4. Similar to the program listed in number 3, the program that computes
   frequencies is freq.py and is already an executable and thus can be
   run with "./freq.py" command. It is implemented in python3 and needs no
   external libraries. Also similar to rev.py, it can optionally take
   a command line argument which is a fasta file in order to compute
   the frequencies of a nucleotide and dinucleotide sequence. My
   results for nucleotide frequencies were as follows:
	 {'A': 0.2542987918023999, 'T': 0.24712382994515691, 'G': 0.2643189971547565, 'C': 0.		23425838109768668}

	 And dinucleotide frequencies were as follows:
