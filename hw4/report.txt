7. Comparing the two strands we notice that there are roughly an equivalent amount
		of SNPs compared to indels but there seems to be a difference in location. The
		SNPs seem to be closer to the beginning and end of the sequence relative to the
		indels and the indels seems to be centered around position 2600k and fairly
		closely compacted in that area. There are more SNPs than indels by a fair
		amount but the main detail is the location. This could be due to natural
		selection and can potentially affect the structural difference because
		the non_virulent has significantly more deletions. Thus, it's likely that their
		structure is similar until it gets to the "indel area."

11. Contig Statistics:
				Average: 86316.346320
				Longest: 984690
				Total:231
	
	I would say that it is not a good assembly because of the generated dotplot.
	The diagonal is nearly empty and thus the assembly has little match. This could
	be because of inferrence from inimportant regions over others and will likely
	cause different structures.
